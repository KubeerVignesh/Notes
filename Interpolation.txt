The String InterPolation is used for changing the "Static variable" into "Dynamic Variable"..
for example: 
	hello John  (where john is static Variable)

Static Variable : The value can't be change (or) fixed then it is called as Static Variable..
Dynamic Variable : The value which can be changed it is called Dynamic Variable..
		We have to create variable and assign the value to it.

Converting Static Variable to Dynamic Variable
------------------------------------------------------------
For Example:
	//Static Variable
	<h2>Hello John</h2>
	
	//Dynamic Variable
	name:string = " John";
	<h2>Hello {{name}}</h2>

 {{}}=>It is a one type of console.

DisAdvantage Of InterPolation
----------------------------------------
 => This method is only work on String
 => If we use boolean value then the value is not changes because,interpolation method is only work on Stings.....
